After uploding I have come to the idea that maybe the
whole `P vs NP` problem is flawed. Let me explain.

`P vs NP` is defined as a `turing machine` that can
solve a problem as quickly as it can check an answer
for said problem. In my mind this means checking or
solving without multi-threading, because being
threaded has the advantage of doing 'more than one'
operation at once and is not a `turing machine`.
Also from my previous revelation, this may boil
down to compression and being able to solve a
compressed problem as fast as a uncompressed
one (CNF and DNF format). However, lets look at
the operations used to do our simple boolean.

`ADD` and `SUB` for CPUs is basic enough and taken for
granted that they do 'one operation'. But `OR` and `AND`
are not 'normal' arithmetic and the way a human and
computer may process them may be a bit different. For
example, you can `00000000 OR 11110000` and easily have
a machine do what sommeone learning how to `OR` may do.
`0 OR 1` ... next place `0 OR 1` ... next place, and so
on. But a machine can `OR` multiple bits at once, and
isn't that by definition - multi-threading? Representing
different items and acting on them simultaineously
is certainly getting more information out effort put in.

And as far as the `turing machine` part goes, maybe a
mechanical machine's limits are more about part strength
than lithography sizes, but the act of 'multi-tasking'
can still be done. For a mechanical machine there may be
more physical space required than a micro-chip, but even
on a chip there are more wires weaved together the more
we advance technology. We used to only be able to `OR/AND`
8 bit at a time, then 16, 32, 64, even 128. Maybe in our
lifetime we can reach 1024 bit computers that are, in all
technicality, doing over 1000 things at once as a 'base
operation'.

After realizing the ask, and the actual action(s), I have
come to the conclusion that maybe the whole question is
off from its origin. Is it a simple `operations vs time`
question? Is it a matter of definition? One turing 'peck'
equals one 'operation'? Is it more about balance between
resources inside the machine operating? Is it how the
operations are done? If we go off the definition of
`turing machine`, I'd say no attempt has been even close
and that `P` is most certainly not `NP`. But if we look
at how we have modeled computers, and how anything alive
with what we commonly call a `brain` computes, then I'd
say it's a matter of when technology hits a tipping point.
